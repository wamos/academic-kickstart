* Implement a prototype on Raspberry Pi with a compatible camera, perform transcoding and opportunistic 
uploading to overcome constraints, such as limited storage space and battery capacity
* Wearable cameras are very useful for crowdsensing platforms, as the wearable cameras mitigate the
burden of holding cameras for participants, and provide much larger video sensing coverage
